# Welcome to Eris Jacey's Personal Website

Hi everyone! This repo contains all the source code I used to develop my website from scratch, including the various tools used to build, package and deploy it. Feel free to look around and use any part of it as a template if you so desire (please just let me know in advance).

## Coming Soon

This website is currently undergoing a slight overhaul UI-wise. Stay tuned!

*A huge thanks to my buddy Farid Tan for helping me out with this!*
